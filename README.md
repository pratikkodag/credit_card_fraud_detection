Credit Card Fraud Detection:-

This repository hosts a comprehensive approach to detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. Dealing with the inherent imbalance in fraud datasets, this project employs "undersampling methods" to ensure robust model performance. The main highlights include:

Data Preprocessing: Utilizes undersampling techniques to balance the dataset, crucial for effective fraud detection.

Model Comparison: Evaluates several machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and a Voting Classifier ensemble to determine the most effective approach.

Evaluation Metrics: Emphasizes accuracy scores, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics to gauge model performance under different scenarios.

This project serves as a practical guide for implementing fraud detection systems using Python's data science ecosystem, showcasing best practices in handling imbalanced data and selecting optimal machine learning algorithms.
